# CPU Stress Dummy Script
 
This project contains a simple Python script designed to simulate CPU load for testing and system monitoring purposes. The script is ideal for use cases such as automated deployment and scheduled background execution (e.g., via cron) to ensure consistent CPU utilization.
 
## Features
 
- Runs for a configurable duration and thread count
- Designed to consume specified CPU resources
- Simple CLI interface
- Suitable for CI/CD deployment to Ubuntu servers
 
## Requirements
 
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Ubuntu Server (tested on 20.04+)
 
## Usage
 
```bash
python3 cpu_stress.py [--threads N] [--minutes DURATION]
--threads N: Number of CPU threads to use (default: 2)
--minutes DURATION: Duration in minutes to run (default: 15)
Example (run with 2 threads for 15 minutes):

Bash
python3 cpu_stress.py --threads 2 --minutes 15
Deployment (CI/CD Example)
This repo includes a sample GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy the script to an Oracle Ubuntu server via SSH.
See .github/workflows/deploy.yml for details.

Scheduled Execution
To automate hourly execution, add the following cron entry:

Bash
0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/{USER}/cpu_stress.py --threads 2 --minutes 15
